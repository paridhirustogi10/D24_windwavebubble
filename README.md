# Wind-Wave-Bubble Gas Transfer Velocity Formulation (Deike et al., 2025)
==========================

Authors: Luc Deike, Paridhi Rustogi, Xiaohui Zhao (Princeton University)

Creation Date: March 01, 2025

Description: This script uses the D25 wind-wave-bubble formulation to reproduce Figure 3 from the main text (without DMS).

==========================

Input Variables:

Wind Speed (m/s): JRA55-do v1.5 forcing (Tsujino et al., 2018).
Significant Wave Height (m): Wavewatch III (WAVEWATCH III Development Group. (2016))
Gas Properties: Ostwald solubility and diffusivity from Wanninkhof (2009).
This script models the interaction of wind, waves, and gas transfer, contributing to the understanding of oceanic gas exchange processes.
